I learned a lot by doing two rides worth of distance and climbing in one day today.  Fortunately no bad lessons like "you're not strong enough to do that!" but still.  I think that while my body is up to the task, my enjoyment is lessened - it turned into more work, less joyful exploration and play.  I stopped enjoying the miles as much as counting them down, I skipped things I might have stopped to check out on a shorter day.  Much of my body started to hurt by the end of the ride, but some preemptive advil midafternoon along with some bonus electrolytes seemed to help me make it all the way to the end.
<p>
Still, another beautiful day!  Left as early as I could convince myself to in the cold, 7:45.  Ate an especially hearty breakfast, oatmeal + fruits + pb&j tortilla + the remains of some jerky I'd bought.  3 hours later, after the biggest climb of the day, had an all I could eat buffet with an incredible glacier view out the window, before getting back on the bike to keep snacking across Canada.

The big climb was big but it was nice to get it done nearly first thing.  That seems to be my preference - get the hard thing out of the way and then enjoy the rest of the day.  They've given the glacier a frankly amazing visitor center and some tours and movies and a starbucks and 2 restaurants, well, let's say it didn't look like that in my 17-year-old memory.  Not sure we'll even be able to "stand on" the glacier these days, maybe walk up to it?  We'll find out more when I get back there with Lori and we think about some of the tours/etc.  During the climb and the downhill after, I passed a solid dozen cyclists, more than one touring, all coming the other way - but just waved.  It was too cold and trafficky to cross the road to chat at that point.  Or I / they were too tired?  Something!
<p>
Despite preparing for the long day, I still hadn't finally decided until arriving at the campground where I was planning to stay the night assuming I didn't "do the double".  I sat there, had a snack and reapplied sunscreen, and finally decided to just go - it was 1pm and I had at least 8 hours of light to make 50 miles, mostly downhill.  Thank goodness it was mostly downhill, I was certainly not full of energy although I also was never really out of stamina perhaps because I started setting a timer to remind myself to eat more, drink more, and reapply sunscreen every hour for that long second half of the day?  Not sure, but glad I had the foresight to focus on nutrition so I didn't bonk!

The weather was generally nice, but a bit blustery, sometimes in headwind format.  Rarely for long, but long enough to make me actually hunker down in the drops for awhile.  I also never really warmed up until well after I got off the summit where all the glacier stuff was.  At one point I saw darkness ahead in a valley I had to ride through, and it started to sprinkle, so I did something I rarely do: put on my rain gear before it started raining!  Usually I'm more of a "wait until I'm already soaked to try to protect from further soaking" kinda guy but today I decided it was a pretty sure thing and most of all I wasn't already hot and sweaty, so it wasn't a recipe for instant misery.  About 3 miles later it had sprinkled slightly, and a tremendous headwind had slowed me down while pushing the clouds overhead quickly and I was thankful for a head wind for maybe the first time ever, and I found no place to lean my bike but was starting to sweat inside the rain gear so laid my bike on the ground and peeled off the layer.  Passing cars sure thought I was just stripping down but I had clothes under my rain gear - so, no free show for passing motorists!
<p>
Shortly after this, I spy an oncoming touring cyclist and he wants to stop and chat so he crosses the road and we chat for a few minutes.  I immediately notice his homemade <b>ear fairings</b> - covers for his ears, attached to his helmet straps, to block out the wind and traffic noise.  After complimenting him on them and introductions (he's Roy, from Edmonton, done a lot of touring and loves it;  I was the only "properly loaded" person he had seen lately - he's not into the minimal bikepacking rigs, he likes his touring kit and being prepared and camping!  He was a nice/fun guy and appreciated that I loved touring the same way he did - it's comfortable and feels productive but also tugs the heartstrings somehow.  Funny story - he also admitted to preemptively putting his rain gear on around when I did (recall he was approaching me so we were looking ahead to the rain - which did pass through before us based on the wet ground).  He joked - same joke I always make - that putting it on preempts the rain.  He was also camping at the campground I had decided not to, would have made a friend there had I stayed!  (we would have had the campground to ourselves, it looked like - no running water at that one).  We went our ways and I was glad to have met him.

Second lunch at sunwapta lodge was unremarkable but it was nice not to have to make a pb&j tortilla.  Started setting timers to remind myself to eat so did pretty good at nutrition for maybe the second time in my life (the first time, someone else who was good at it made me a regiment that wokred well during my one and only half ironman triathlon)?  Usually I eat and drink a lot in the morning and skate through most of the day on that like a camel, but that only stretches so far.  Even with my buffet lunch, I was not going to be able to make it all the way.  Today's snacks were:
<p>
<ul>
<li> cookie, soda, yogurt at lodge
<li> sesame bars
<li> kind bar
<li> more sesame bars
</ul>
<p>
Rolled into the town of Jasper about 10 hours after I started. Figuring >2 hours of not-moving downtime (between lunch and other breaks), not a bad ride, for me, (loaded with more than 4,000 feet of climbing).  I did opt out of the singletrack trail into town, though - couldn't handle a punchy climb at that point!  Rolled up to wrong hostel, then routed to the fortunately nearby right hostel, then clean and dinner and chat with Lori and now for sleep.
