A somewhat blah beginning to the trip - I usually bike out the door.  But instead I let Lori drive me to the train station in Portland yesterday since it was raining somewhat hard and I didn't want to be damp for the overnight train trip.  It was a good decision, and the train trip was ok.  I didn't sleep well despite having a double seat to myself all night, since the woman behind me was coughing nonstop and I was wearing a mask all night, but morning eventually came. I got my bike loaded at the station and set off into the dawn for a quick bagel-y breakfast.  Sacramento is pretty empty on a Sunday morning before the sun rises, which suited me fine to ride through the unknown streets while finding my way.
<p>
As I rode I watched my Garmin tell me about all of the cute named alleys I was passing - tomato alley, historic alley, improv alley - as I cruised out of town on H street into East Sacramento.  I stripped off a layer and munched on cookies as I made it to CSU Sacramento and took a quick wrong turn into the arboretum, and then figured it out and reversed course to the river where I'd spend much of the rest of the day on the waterfront path.
<p>
It was an interesting change of pace to see, instead of Portland-traditional spoiling crabapples in the bike lane, freshly fallen citrus since the trees here are still fruiting, and the palms are green and even some roses are blooming, right next to still-illuminated Christmas lights.
<p>
The waterfront path was GREAT; pavement was well maintained, wide, and striped the whole way - about 20 miles - that I rode it, and I passed dozens of friendly runners, and was passed by a few friendly cyclists as the miles spooled by.  The dawn turned to mist for an hour or so before the sun broke through as I snacked on the last of Lori's homemade cookies, my primary post-breakfast food today until a fantastic dinner.  The path-park was frequently quite large (not just a few feet wide as Portland's tends to be) and featured ducks, geese, swans, and even some turkeys in additional to the fairly copious - but never crowded - human traffic.
<p>
I got off the path around 11:30am and set out through suburbia starting in Folsom and heading towards Roseville, where I was to meet and stay with a friend.  The suburban miles were pretty ho-hum especially after that stellar waterfront path/park.  I did get a few miles on various MUP's even after I left the waterfront trail so that was a nice respite from the hilly, variably residential or industrial streets that my route took me on - a route cobbled together from RidewithGPS heatmaps and google maps' idea of where bike lanes and trails might be.
<p>
I stopped to see a sculpture garden, send some texts, and made it to my friend's house around 1.  Enjoyed hanging out with him, his partner, and their pups, playing some bocci and board games, eating a phenomenal vegan dinner, and turning in to bed around 9:30 so I can get up in the morning and do it all over again.  But, it's nice to be staying in a homely home with some wonderful folks (and animals) on my first night out on the road!
<p>
Tomorrow:  Davis, CA, one of the bikiest cities in America!
