        <h1>More downhill than up</h1>
        <h2>
           Soggy night gave way to brilliant riding
        </h2>

<p>
After I went to bed, the park ranger came over and forced my compatriot to move his tent to comply with an unstated rule that limited us to the parking area of our campsite for erecting tents, rather than the surrounding, more comfortable dirt.  I'd stuck my tent in the gravel since there wasn't an already-clear space big enough in said dirt and I was in a hurry to get set up before everything could get soaked.  But Albert got up from his slumber and re-pitched his tent and then it proceeded to rain all night, finally letting up sometime around 3 so I could go pee without needing rain gear, though it had restarted in earnest by the time the sun rose.  
<p>
We had a plan to go eat in the cafe on the way out of the camp area, but instead spent quite some time drying up and packing up (I cooked myself some oatmeal breakfast while he tried to dry his stuff under a hand drier), and so since it was merely sprinkling and not raining hard when I went past the cafe, I just kept riding.  I knew the next 5km since I'd been down intending to camp down the road already, but after that it was unknown, though I saw <a href=https://ridewithgps.com/routes/46937657>on RidewithGPS</a> that there was some substantial elevation gain, so I was anxious to get it started so I could get it done.
<p>
The sprinkle stuck with me for the first 10 miles or so, at which point I stopped for a snack.  As I rolled, the rain stopped and the sun started to peek through and has stayed with us since about 9:30am, which made both the ride and the afternoon of hanging out in a park in the middle of Princeton, BC, much nicer!  But first we had to get there...

After cresting the summit, I knew there was still climbing so I didn't start celebrating too quickly, but after the next climb, this sign indicated that it might, indeed, be celebration time:

<p>
And so it was mostly downhill into Princeton and there was much zooming (<a href=https://www.strava.com/activities/11565985880>link to Strava workout</a>).  Needing a rest day before I can climb anymore without serious grumbling, I found a suitable cheap hotel to stay at a couple nights, and have managed to get my tent dried out already and most of my gear charged.  Albert and I will have dinner together with the warmshowers hosts and then he'll set out tomorrow and quickly outdistance me since he's leaving a day earlier, bit also, he's younger, fitter, and has an ebike.  The reason I caught him yesterday is that his bike ran out of battery, which is the main reason I had never considered touring on an ebike...
