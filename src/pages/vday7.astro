  Ended up getting quite a wweetheart deal on the campsite; had to wait a bit for the office to open but then they only wanted 20 bucks, cheapest stay I've had other than home stays!  I had realized as I went to sleep that I'd lost the headphones I was wearing when I arrived, but managed to find it on the ground by the office this morning.  Remarked on my luck to Lori and then immediately went to the bathroom and pooped in a stall that was without toilet paper and had to waddle to the next one to clean up, but had a good ride into town nonetheless.
<p>
  I'm in a geography that allows or even encourages long, straight roads though nowhere.  I guess that's the benefit of agricultural zones without many people to break things up?  Both yesterday and today I rode for 8+ miles in a straight line and saw very few other people.  It's peaceful, though moreso when you know that it is coming than when you are discovering a route and wondering if it will ever get back to civilization.
  Whilst on the long haul, I saw another recreational cyclist (roadie); we waved and went our ways. Interetingly, I also saw one coming into town from the south last week - and saw them nowhere else except on the 17 mile bike path up between Redding and the Shasta dam.  Makes me think there aren't a ton of roadies around, outside of Davis?  Not sure.
<p>
  It was another tail windy day - made great time and didn't work too hard.
<p>
  I met my host coming home on his bike right as I pulled up.  Very friendly fellow, suggested some trails to go ride so I did.
<p>
  After dropping off my bags, underbiked up in the nature preserve but then had the best time on criss cross singletrack along the creek for a few miles back into town.  Missed the pool he suggested I take a dip in but didn't go back for it. 
<p>
  Picked up beer per hosts stated taste to have with dinner; I got the "garage dweller" since it was a hazy IPA as requested - and my room is in the garage.  Chatted with the host family for quite awhile before turning in.  They're the kind of folks we'd be friends with if we lived here.  Bikey and kind and friendly and curious and fun.  I am glad I've made the effort to do so many homestays this trip;  they've all been wonderful!
