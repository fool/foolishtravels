additional reading section: 
- linking shannon and marco's blog and better videos
- bike route network link

misc wrapup work:
- tagging ridewithGPS routes / adding to a trip (part 1 & 2 maybe?)
- creating single timelapse video and uploading to youtube
- creating photo gallery
- updating to latest astro
- maybe putting maps/distance from strava in each post?  not so sure about that

themes:

- sunsets and sunrises - just spots in a cycle notable for their color and depth.  A great sunset on last night camping helped seal the trip as a communing with nature and not just a bicycle ride.

- road shoulders
