Didn't lose much

What did I send back? 

What did I not use? 

What wore out? 

Gear change For next time? (Tent, cooler helmet, camera)

Also somehow tie in the late connections via rail (Western) and road (Winnipeg and East?) (not sure what I meant there...)

maybe take a look at "further reading" at the end of "Railway Nation"?  Esp Breton.

takeaways around camping versus hotelling, but weight and heat and climbs vs lightness, too?  Maybe time to level up my bikepacking skills of not having too many clothes and other things?  Would like to travel more lightly in the future without not being able to camp, tho...

"for the last month or so of my trip including the train back to the US through new england, I was basking in the beginnings of autumn as touches of red started to tinge the forests and fields"

locale name changes - rat portage to kenora, fort william to thunder bay, new  westminster and others to vancouver, wawa, laggan to lake louise, etc.

+(whatever is in the email in my inbox)

additional reading section: 
- linking shannon and marco's blog and better videos
- bike route network link

misc wrapup work:
- tagging ridewithGPS routes / adding to a trip (part 1 & 2 maybe?)
- creating single timelapse video and uploading to youtube
- creating photo gallery
- updating to latest astro
- maybe putting maps/distance from strava in each post?  not so sure about that

themes:

- don't forget to try the plain poutine/bagels sometimes.  

- lean into local expertise.  Helped lots of times!  e.g. what restaurant to avoid in that town where I ate a jimmy dean sausage roll for breakfast at 7am exactly. (and the lady there who made sure I knew the parameters of breakfast in advance!)

museums / history stories beyond the railroad (but also including it).  e.g. brewster company in banff/jasper

- sunsets and sunrises - just spots in a cycle notable for their color and depth.  A great sunset on last night camping helped seal the trip as a communing with nature and not just a bicycle ride.

- road shoulders
 
fumbling in french.  je me souvient and how gatineau felt like vancouver

mosquito-fear almost always worse than mosquito-truth
