Got stuck in Thunder Bay a bit longer than intended, but it was a good town to hang out in!  I got a haircut, visited two museums, biked 50 miles, almost won a prize at the pinball pub, resupplied for food and some bike gear (gloves, sunscreen, extra spokes, and a better helmet light), and in general enjoyed sleeping in beds and eating foods prepared by others (I think I had 4 pizzas over the 4 days I was there!).  Most towns on the route have some "large statue by the roadside" and for Thunder Bay, I found this statue...of covid 19?

Set out fairly early after a meh tim horton's breakfast.  The first 20 miles or so I had previewed much of yesterday to go see the Terry Fox Memorial which is illegal to bike to (but I did it anyway), saving me some climbing with all my bags on today.  The memorial (and the guy and his daily marathon, halfway across canada, with only one leg, to raise awareness that cancer does not mean your life is over and you can't still achieve big things) was pretty touching.  Most of today I was on the "Terry Fox Courage Freeway" until it suddenly ended near my end stop.  Since Terry ran effective "to" Thunder Bay from the East Coast...I would think it could have been longer!

There were a couple gas stations today on my ride, and one of them had "distance to Toronto" for some reason, so here it is:

<p>
...already made some pretty good progress on that 1400k today!  While I was at that gas station, I sat down at a table to drink my preferred energy drink, and was pleased by the nice view...

The next gas station proclaimed itself a "cyclist's haven" but it just seemed like a normal quickie mart to me...

All day as I rode next to the (north shore of) Lake Superior, there was no shortage of Superior stuff:

Today's ride was another record-settingly-quick 50 miles and beyond.  But it stayed fairly cool and pleasant to ride right up until the very end when I started to get tired, it got more hilly, and a headwind developed.  However, I think I did pretty good work to pull into town around 1:30p.  I was worried since some of the local motels were full and it is saturday night, but the campground was half-empty and the cheapest I've had so far - 11$ CAD!  But no showers, wifi, and maybe no drinking water?  Will go check on that in a moment and see if I need to pedal up into town to buy myself a gallon or what.  But first, I'm gonna take a dip in Lake Superior since...I'm here and it will rinse some sweat and dirt and sunscreen off and it's warm enough to drip dry quicklike.
