Had another crisis of faith (read: is this something I want to be doing, all summer?) today, prompted by of all things, a tech snafu.  My bike computer refused to boot up despite being fully charged when I was done riding yesterday. It's not super essential since I have my phone and my routes are saved in RidewithGPS which is very usable from the phone, even without cell signal.  But, it's a big psychological safety blanket to have the computer staring at me anytime I need to believe I'm making progress or confirm I'm not off course.  Further, my phone battery doesn't last super long when being used to track activities in real time...and I'd <i>just</i> mailed my bike-handlebars phone mount back to the states, since I hadn't used it yet!  I use the Garmin bike computer to navigate but also to track the work: How much further?  (so I'm now 1/6th of the way there, and I'll be 1/5th in how long?) How steep is this anyway?  (I don't try to ride 9+% grade with my load, but walk it instead since I can barely spin in first gear at that steepness with all the weight on the bike).
<p>
In this state of distraction, I rode towards the major town of the day, Osooyos, scheming about how I could possibly get a replacement computer anytime soon, plotting how I'd pitch my woes to their tech support team to convince them to send me a new one, rather than buying another computer;  this one is only 2 months old and it's not cheap!  I was planning to call from lunch at Osooyos; but when I got there, I did try the standard "turn it off and on again" trick - in this case, "hold the power button for awhile and try to reset it" and of course...it started right up!  Disaster averted before lunch!  Now I had to face down my naysaying morning-self who assumed it would take all afternoon to resolve the Garmin situation and had decided "well, we can stay in Osooyos while we work to resolve this;  don't have to worry about climbing 3500 feet in the afternoon heat after all!"

Friend Elden sent me a text today that "you will" (get through it) and somehow his gentle assurance was a big part of what motivated me to set out up the hill.  I walked more than half of the way up - 5+ miles on foot by my estimate - all of the steepest parts but also just when I was too tired, or the shoulder was barely there (it often disappeared on a blind corner with a steep drop off just across a large concrete barrier with no room to walk outside of it, frustratingly).  I felt like maybe I could react better to an approaching car on foot rather than weaving up the hill at my "barely able to pedal" pace - 5mph (walking speed:  3.7mph, so it wasn't much slower...)
<p>
As I sat at a viewpoint at the halfway point, I had decided to solicit a ride for me and my bike.  It'd have to be in a pickup truck since I can't squeeze my bike inside a vehicle and I have to be able to put my bags somewhere (I can't really lift the bike with all my gear attached to it).  There were a couple likely suspects at the overlook - 2/3 of the cars parked there while I'm sitting there for 45 minutes are pickup trucks - but frustratingly, neither budges during that whole time and by this point I'm rested and say fuck it - I'll just ride/walk!

I had left town around 1pm and got to the top of the 17ish mile climb at 5:15pm, after stopping at the only restaurant within 20 miles, which was a decent mexican cafe in the middle of nowhere.  Thank goodness for the meal so I don't have to cook tonight and I was feeling pretty under-nutritioned and dehydrated by that point.  But also the restaurant was at a spot where there was only 2.2 miles left to ride to the campground - and yet, 500 feet to climb still - quite a steep ending for a long day.  But, I rode that whole final climb without walking after calculating that it probably at least wasn't 9+% grade.  (Garmin agreed).

The <a href=https://www.campingrvbc.com/sites/bc/summit-rv-resort-bridesville/>campground & RV park</a> is a little hippy-dippy but I felt welcomed and they moved me to a spot with better grass so the tent is cushy tonight.  Also I was told to "shower like you're at home!  30 minutes, an hour, two hours, go nuts!" but I only took a normal shower.  Still, it was my sweatiest day yet and so the shower was excellent.  Set up camp very slowly, took a handful of electrolyte pills to hopefully stave off cramps that I felt coming on, and now I am typing this wearing the dorkiest hat (with the mosquito netting) since the bugs were giving me some grief, although not really the biting type fortunately.
